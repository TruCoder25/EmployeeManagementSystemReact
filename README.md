# 🧑‍💼 Employee Management System using React

This is a front-end focused **Employee Management System** built with **React**. It enables users to perform essential operations such as adding, editing, and viewing employee records. Instead of using a backend server or database, this project uses the browser's **LocalStorage** to persist data across sessions.
